'                          Version 3, 19 November 2007
'
'    Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
'    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
'    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
'
'                               Preamble
'
'     The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
'   software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
'   cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.
'
'     The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
'   to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
'   our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
'   share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
'   software for all its users.
'
'     When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
'   price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
'   have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
'   them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
'   want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
'   free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
'
'     Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
'   with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
'   you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
'   and/or modify the software.
'
'     A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
'   improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
'   receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
'   incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
'   encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
'   software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
'   The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
'   letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
'   source code to the public.
'
'     The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
'   ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
'   to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
'   provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
'   users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
'   a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
'   code of the modified version.
'
'     An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
'   published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is
'   a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
'   released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
'   this license.
'
'     The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
'   modification follow.
'
'                          TERMS AND CONDITIONS
'
'     0. Definitions.
'
'     "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.
'
'     "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
'   works, such as semiconductor masks.
'
'     "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
'   License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
'   "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
'
'     To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
'   in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
'   exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
'   earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
'
'     A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
'   on the Program.
'
'     To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
'   permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
'   infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
'   computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
'   distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
'   public, and in some countries other activities as well.
'
'     To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
'   parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
'   a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
'
'     An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
'   to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
'   feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
'   tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
'   extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
'   work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
'   the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
'   menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
'
'     1. Source Code.
'
'     The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
'   for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
'   form of a work.
'
'     A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
'   standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
'   interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
'   is widely used among developers working in that language.
'
'     The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
'   than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
'   packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
'   Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
'   Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
'   implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
'   "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
'   (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
'   (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
'   produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
'
'     The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
'   the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
'   work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
'   control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
'   System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
'   programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
'   which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
'   includes interface definition files associated with source files for
'   the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
'   linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
'   such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
'   subprograms and other parts of the work.
'
'     The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
'   can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
'   Source.
'
'     The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
'   same work.
'
'     2. Basic Permissions.
'
'     All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
'   copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
'   conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
'   permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
'   covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
'   content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
'   rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
'
'     You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
'   convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
'   in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
'   of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
'   with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
'   the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
'   not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
'   for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
'   and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
'   your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
'
'     Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
'   the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
'   makes it unnecessary.
'
'     3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
'
'     No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
'   measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
'   11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
'   similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
'   measures.
'
'     When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
'   circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
'   is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
'   the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
'   modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
'   users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
'   technological measures.
'
'     4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
'
'     You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
'   receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
'   appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
'   keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
'   non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
'   keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
'   recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
'
'     You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
'   and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
'
'     5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
'
'     You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
'   produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
'   terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
'
'       a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
'       it, and giving a relevant date.
'
'       b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
'       released under this License and any conditions added under section
'       7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
'       "keep intact all notices".
'
'       c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
'       License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
'       License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
'       additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
'       regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
'       permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
'       invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
'
'       d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
'       Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
'       interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
'       work need not make them do so.
'
'     A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
'   works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
'   and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
'   in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
'   "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
'   used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
'   beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
'   in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
'   parts of the aggregate.
'
'     6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
'
'     You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
'   of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
'   machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
'   in one of these ways:
'
'       a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
'       (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
'       Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
'       customarily used for software interchange.
'
'       b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
'       (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
'       written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
'       long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
'       model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
'       copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
'       product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
'       medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
'       more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
'       conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
'       Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
'
'       c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
'       written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
'       alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
'       only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
'       with subsection 6b.
'
'       d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
'       place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
'       Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
'       further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
'       Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
'       copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
'       may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
'       that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
'       clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
'       Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
'       Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
'       available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
'
'       e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
'       you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
'       Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
'       charge under subsection 6d.
'
'     A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
'   from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
'   included in conveying the object code work.
'
'     A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
'   tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
'   or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
'   into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
'   doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
'   product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
'   typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
'   of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
'   actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
'   is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
'   commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
'   the only significant mode of use of the product.
'
'     "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
'   procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
'   and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
'   a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
'   suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
'   code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
'   modification has been made.
'
'     If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
'   specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
'   part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
'   User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
'   fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
'   Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
'   by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
'   if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
'   modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
'   been installed in ROM).
'
'     The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
'   requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
'   for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
'   the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
'   network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
'   adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
'   protocols for communication across the network.
'
'     Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
'   in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
'   documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
'   source code form), and must require no special password or key for
'   unpacking, reading or copying.
'
'     7. Additional Terms.
'
'     "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
'   License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
'   Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
'   be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
'   that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
'   apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
'   under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
'   this License without regard to the additional permissions.
'
'     When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
'   remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
'   it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
'   removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
'   additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
'   for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
'
'     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
'   add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
'   that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
'
'       a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
'       terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
'
'       b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
'       author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
'       Notices displayed by works containing it; or
'
'       c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
'       requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
'       reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
'
'       d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
'       authors of the material; or
'
'       e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
'       trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
'
'       f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
'       material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
'       it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
'       any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
'       those licensors and authors.
'
'     All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
'   restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
'   received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
'   governed by this License along with a term that is a further
'   restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
'   a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
'   License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
'   of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
'   not survive such relicensing or conveying.
'
'     If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
'   must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
'   additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
'   where to find the applicable terms.
'
'     Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
'   form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
'   the above requirements apply either way.
'
'     8. Termination.
'
'     You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
'   provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
'   modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
'   this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
'   paragraph of section 11).
'
'     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
'   license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
'   provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
'   finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
'   holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
'   prior to 60 days after the cessation.
'
'     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
'   reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
'   violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
'   received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
'   copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
'   your receipt of the notice.
'
'     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
'   licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
'   this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
'   reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
'   material under section 10.
'
'     9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
'
'     You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
'   run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
'   occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
'   to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
'   nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
'   modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
'   not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
'   covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
'
'     10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
'
'     Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
'   receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
'   propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
'   for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
'
'     An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
'   organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
'   organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
'   work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
'   transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
'   licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
'   give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
'   Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
'   the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
'
'     You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
'   rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
'   not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
'   rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
'   (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
'   any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
'   sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
'
'     11. Patents.
'
'     A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
'   License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
'   work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
'
'     A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
'   owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
'   hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
'   by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
'   but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
'   consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
'   purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
'   patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
'   this License.
'
'     Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
'   patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
'   make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
'   propagate the contents of its contributor version.
'
'     In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
'   agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
'   (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
'   sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
'   party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
'   patent against the party.
'
'     If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
'   and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
'   to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
'   publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
'   then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
'   available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
'   patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
'   consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
'   license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
'   actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
'   covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
'   in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
'   country that you have reason to believe are valid.
'
'     If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
'   arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
'   covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
'   receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
'   or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
'   you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
'   work and works based on it.
'
'     A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
'   the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
'   conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
'   specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
'   work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
'   in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
'   to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
'   the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
'   parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
'   patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
'   conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
'   for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
'   contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
'   or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
'
'     Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
'   any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
'   otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
'
'     12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
'
'     If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
'   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
'   excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
'   covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
'   License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
'   not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
'   to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
'   the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
'   License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
'
'     13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.
'
'     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
'   Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
'   interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version
'   supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding
'   Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source
'   from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary
'   means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source
'   shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3
'   of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the
'   following paragraph.
'
'     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
'   permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
'   under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single
'   combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
'   License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
'   but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version
'   3 of the GNU General Public License.
'
'     14. Revised Versions of this License.
'
'     The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
'   the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions
'   will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
'   address new problems or concerns.
'
'     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
'   Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General
'   Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
'   option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
'   version or of any later version published by the Free Software
'   Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
'   GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
'   by the Free Software Foundation.
'
'     If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
'   versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's
'   public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
'   to choose that version for the Program.
'
'     Later license versions may give you additional or different
'   permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
'   author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
'   later version.
'
'     15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
'
'     THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
'   APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
'   HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
'   OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
'   THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
'   PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
'   IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
'   ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
'
'     16. Limitation of Liability.
'
'     IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
'   WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
'   THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
'   GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
'   USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
'   DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
'   PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
'   EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
'   SUCH DAMAGES.
'
'     17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
'
'     If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
'   above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
'   reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
'   an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
'   Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
'   copy of the Program in return for a fee.
'
'                        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
